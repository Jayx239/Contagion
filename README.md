Advanced Java Final Project ECEC-301
A top down java based zombie shooter.
Problem statement:
Make a java base top down zombie shooter game in 6 days implementing programming concepts outlined
in Drexel's ECEC-301 class.

To run (zipped):
unzip files
run splash screen.java

To run (from github: https://github.com/Jayx239/Contagion):
Clone
Run SplashScreen.java
press enter to begin game

Controls:
keyboard keys:
Movement:
w: move up
s: move down
a: move left
d: mover right
(Combinations of keys move player diagonally)

Shooting:
up arrow: shoot up
down arrow: shoot down
left arrow: shoot left
right arrow: shoot right
(Combinations of keys shoot diagonally)

Respawn:
On death press the r key to respawn (Zombies keep generating so respawn quick!)

Known bugs:
Splash screen sometimes doesn't display ""press enter" to play
On initial splash screen if you press enter too quickly it may crash, (This may have been fixed, testing needed)
Initialization of game frame may take a few seconds, from there on it runs smoothly
Bullets sometimes get stuck
Zombies and player can go over health hud, not changing because I like it that way

Im sure there are other bugs that I am either not thinking of or I have not seen yet. Feedback is always
appreciated.
